# **App Name**: SciVerse

## Core Features:

- Interactive Graph Plotting: Display mathematical functions using the Desmos Graphing Calculator API. Users can input functions and see them plotted in real-time.
- Compound Information Display: Fetch and display chemical compound data from the PubChem PUG REST API. Users can search for compounds, and the app will display molecular structure, IUPAC name, molecular formula, and a brief description.
- Physics Calculator Hub: Provide a suite of physics calculators, organized by topic, that compute results based on user-provided inputs and display these results in a clear format. Input validation will be implemented.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and knowledge.
- Secondary color: A light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds to ensure readability and a clean aesthetic.
